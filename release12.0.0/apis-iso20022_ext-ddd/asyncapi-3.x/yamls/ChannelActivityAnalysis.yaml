  description: >-
    BIAN Service Domain (expanded with the BIAN BOM) | This Service domain
    tracks and analyzes channel activity to support relationship development, to
    detect unwanted behavior, possible fraud, and to constrain channel use as
    necessary (for example tracking usage frequency and cumulative transaction
    amounts within a period)
