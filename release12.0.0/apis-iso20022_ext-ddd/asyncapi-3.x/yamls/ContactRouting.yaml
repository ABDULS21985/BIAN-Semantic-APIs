  description: >-
    BIAN Service Domain (expanded with the BIAN BOM) | The Contact Routing
    service domain tracks servicing resource availability and uses any known
    details about the customer contact (e.g. identity, indicated purpose of
    call, status of the relationship) to make an optimal routing decision. The
    routing selection may include matching the required product knowledge/skills
    to the available servicing resources.
